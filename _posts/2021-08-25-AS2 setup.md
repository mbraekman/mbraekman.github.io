Many of the B2B-connections are still making use of an AS2-connection to exchange documents. Below you will be able to find out how this can be configured in BizTalk Server and in Azure Integration Services.  
But before we can dive into the how, let's start with the what; what is the AS2-protocol and how does it work.

### What is AS2
AS2, or _Applicability Statement 2_, is a HTTP-based protocol used to transmit messages in a fast and secure manner, primarily used for the business-to-business exchange of documents.  

But how does it work?  
Each message that is to be transmitted towards a specific receiver, _can_ be encrypted and/or _can_ be signed. _Can_, because even though most of the times both are being enabled, this is not a strict requirement for making use of this protocol.  
Next to this, each message should be replied by a sync or async MDN (_or Message Disposition Notification_), which is a technical acknowledgement that indicates the message has been successfully received, has been decrypted and of which the signature has been verified.  
In the diagram below, you can see graphical representation of the exchange of these messages.
