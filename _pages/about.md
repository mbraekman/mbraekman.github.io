Hi, my name is Maxim Braekman, living on the Belgian coast, proud father of a beautiful girl, husband to a lovely wife and working as an Integration Architect at Codit, BE. 

On this blog I'll just be writing about what I've been working on, had troubles with, could be useful for others or just stuff I didn't wanted to forget about - mostly within the Microsoft technology stack.
